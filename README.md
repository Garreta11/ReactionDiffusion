Reaction Diffusion
==========

Processing project to simulate Gray Scott equations. It generates spots, stripes, spirals and maze patterns through a Reaction and Diffusion process.

This project allow users to simulate patterns in a grid. The type of patterns are dependent upon __f__ and __k__ values. Apart from this, there is also an option to view a spatially varying grid where __f__ and __k__ values vary linearly across the grid. The grid wraps toroidally.

The main file in the project is [this processing file](https://github.com/muraliavarma/ReactionDiffusion/blob/master/murali_varma_hw3/murali_varma_hw3.pde). More details can be found in the code comments.
